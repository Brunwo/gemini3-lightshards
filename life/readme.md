# Zinc Spark Simulation

simulation of mammalian egg cell fertilization
It captures the "zinc spark" or "zinc flash"—a rapid release of zinc ions from vesicles in the egg's cortex upon sperm entry. This triggers propagating waves of calcium and zinc across the cell membrane, visualized via fluorescent probes (purple/orange hues indicate zinc concentration gradients).

Initiation: A localized bright flash (zinc release) starts at a single point on the egg's periphery (sperm penetration site).

This "vortex spiral" signature is indeed a universal pattern in excitable biological systems, echoing sacred geometry (e.g., Fibonacci spirals in nature) and potentially linking to electromagnetic

Simulation via a reaction-diffusion model (FitzHugh-Nagumo variant for excitable waves) implemented in a fragment shader.
